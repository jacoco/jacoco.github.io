<h1>EclEmma 2.0 Position Paper</h1><p>
  <i><b>The <a href="../index.html">EclEmma</a> code coverage plug-in for
  Eclipse originally was designed as a wrapper for the
  <a class="extern" href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/">EMMA</a> code coverage
  library to make EMMA available within the Eclipse IDE. Since its initial
  release in 2006 EclEmma became a popular addition to the Eclipse Java IDE. As
  EMMA maintenance has stopped some years ago and we wanted to see functional
  enhancements like branch coverage for EclEmma we started a completely new
  code coverage backend called
  <a href="http://www.jacoco.org/jacoco">JaCoCo</a> under the
  umbrella of the EclEmma project. The purpose of this paper is to setup
  expectations for the EclEmma/JaCoCo user community and serve as a guide line
  for technical decisions. The first release fully backed by JaCoCo is
  "EclEmma 2.0".</b></i>
</p><p style="text-align:right;margin-bottom:15pt">
  Marc R. Hoffmann, Mountainminds GmbH &amp; Co. KG, September 2011 (updated)
</p><h2>Starting Point and Maxims</h2><p>
  Since its initial release in 2006 EclEmma became one of the most widely uses
  code coverage tool in the Java developer's tool box and is one of the
  <a class="extern" href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/metrics/installs">most installed</a>
  Eclipse plug-ins. As EMMA development has stopped shortly after the first
  EclEmma release in 2006 we started working on an alternative called JaCoCo in
  2009. The aim of the <a href="../jacoco/index.html">JaCoCo Project</a> is
  <i>providing a lightweight, flexible and well documented library for
  integration with various build and development tools</i>, see this
  <a href="http://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/mission.html">mission statement</a>
  for details. In the meantime JaCoCo is fully functional and has been adopted
  by several projects. For example the Eclipse platform integration builds are
  analyzed using the JaCoCo Ant tasks. Many open source as well as commercial
  projects use the
  <a class="external" href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/JaCoCo+Plugin">JaCoCo plug-in for Sonar</a>
  to control test quality.
</p><p>
  As EclEmma was originally developed to provide code coverage analysis directly
  for the individual developer, the same now applies for JaCoCo. A consistent
  view to test coverage metrics in the automated builds as well as the local
  Eclipse IDE requires a JaCoCo plug-in for Eclipse. From the EclEmma project's
  point of view there are at least the following three paths towards a JaCoCo
  integration for Eclipse:
</p><ul>
  <li><b>Option 1:</b> Implement a new and separate Eclipse plug-in for JaCoCo.</li>
  <li><b>Option 2:</b> Create a plugable architecture that allows to integrate
      different code coverage technologies.</li>
  <li><b>Option 3:</b> Migrate EclEmma towards JaCoCo (preferred).</li>
</ul><p>
  I propose to follow option 3, which means migrate the existing EclEmma project
  towards JaCoCo. Given the high exposure of EclEmma this options offers a set
  of benefits:
</p><ul>
  <li>Smooth upgrade path to the new version of EclEmma.</li>
  <li>Existing functionality and features of EclEmma like "one-click" launches
      and direct visual feedback within the IDE are kept.</li>
  <li>Proven and robust code base.</li>
</ul><p>
  The other two options appear less attractive due to two main aspects: The
  first point is the EMMA library itself. Given the issues described before and
  the fact that EMMA fails with Java 7 byte code the future use of this great
  but abandoned library is questionable. Therefore maintaining a EMMA-only
  plug-in does not look reasonable in the long run. Users explicitly bound to
  EMMA may continue using the EclEmma 1.x stream (see below).
</p><p>
  Providing a plugable architecture for different coverage libraries looks like
  best practice at the first glance. This is how the overall Eclipse platform
  has been successfully crafted. When looking at different code coverage
  libraries features and integration strategies are very different. For
  example EMMA requires a huge overhead for instrumentation of local class files
  and hooks to tweak class paths. JaCoCo in contrast does not require this but
  gives additional coverage metrics and source highlighting for branch coverage.
  A <i>code coverage framework</i> would therefore either be
</p><ul>
  <li>very small as the common overlapping is small, or</li>
  <li>quite big containing several base services (like class path re-writing)
      for particular code coverage libraries.</li>
</ul><p>
  On the other hand the Eclipse launch and debug framework already is a
  plugable architecture that allows different integrations for different code
  coverage technologies even today.
</p><h2>Functional Improvements</h2><p>
  For EclEmma 2.0 the following functional improvements are planned:
</p><h3>Branch Coverage</h3><p>
  This additional metric will show coverage of all decision points in the
  program flow due to <code>if</code> and <code>switch</code> statements or the
  <code>?</code> operator. The result will be displayed directly in the Java
  editors similar to the JaCoCo reports using a new annotation icon in the left
  ruler. In addition the <i>Coverage</i> view can be switched to branch
  counters. Also the <i>Coverage</i> property page will show branch figures for
  all Java elements. In addition cyclomatic complexity is shown in the view as
  well as on the property page. The former "block" counters will not be
  supported any more.
</p><h3>Faster Launching</h3><p>
  Due the way how the JaCoCo coverage library works there will be no additional
  delay any more when applications under test are launched. This is an
  significant performance improvement especially for large applications and test
  suites.
</p><h3>Less Invasive</h3><p>
  Certain launch types and test scenarios require so called <i>in-place
  instrumentation</i> in EclEmma 1.x. With this option the original class files
  get modified on disk and need to be restored with a clean build when switching
  back to another launch mode. Also JAR files where excluded from coverage
  analysis when <i>in-place</i> mode is activated. Without <i>in-place
  instrumentation</i> the class path of the application under test was modified
  which caused trouble for some applications.
</p><p>
  With EclElmma 2.0 class files on disk will never be modified and the class
  path of an applications stays untouched. This will remove several hassles
  especially for Eclipse application launches and JUnit plug-in tests.
</p><h3>Intermediate and Remote Coverage Analysis</h3><p>
  JaCoCo 2.0 (or more likely one of its subsequent versions) will support
  intermediate coverage dumps on applications running locally or remote without
  stopping the applications under test. This will also allow to reset the
  collected coverage information for a running application.
</p><h3>Flexible Analysis Scope</h3><p>
  The scope of a coverage analysis can be modified at any time afterwards. While
  in EclEmma 1.x the scope needs to be specified on the coverage launch dialog
  <i>before</i> the application is launched, with EclEmma 2.0 the scope can be
  altered at any time when the result of the coverage session is viewed.
</p><h2>The Plug-in Project Name</h2><p>
  Back in 2006 <i>EclEmma</i> originally was an acronym formed from the project
  names Eclipse and EMMA. Today the name is widely used for code coverage in
  Eclipse without an focus on the technology used internally. Therefore the name
  should be kept, also for the plug-in Ids and Java package names. Which
  directly leads to the next point.
</p><h2>Update from EclEmma 1.x to EclEmma 2.0</h2><p>
  Once EclEmma 2.0 has been stabilized and the first release is published
  EclEmma users should be able to get the new JaCoCo based implementation simply
  through the regular update site process.
</p><h2>System Requirements</h2><p>
  EclEmma 2.0 will raise the bar a little bit and has the following system
  requirements:
</p><ul>
<li>
  <b>Java Runtime:</b> As JaCoCo requires Java 1.5 the same minimum JRE is
  required for the Eclipse instance running EclEmma and the application under
  test. Note that this does not apply to the Java class files under test: Any
  class file version ranging from Java 1.0 to 1.7 is possible.
</li>
<li>
  <b>Eclipse:</b> The minimum Eclipse Version to install EclEmma 2.0 is not
  determined yet but the backward compatibility down to Eclipse 3.1 will be
  dropped to get rid of several switches and usages of APIs deprecated in the
  meantime. Anyhow a conservative approach is targeted, e.g. Eclipse 3.5 as the
  minimal supported version.
</li>
<li>
  <b>Operating System:</b> As JaCoCo as well as EclEmma is pure Java all
  operating systems supported by Eclipse will also be supported including
  Windows, Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX and Mac OSX on different architectures.
</li>
</ul><h2>Future support for EMMA and EclEmma 1.x Maintenance</h2><p>
  From EclEmma 2.0 on EMMA will not be supported any more as a coverage engine.
  The only supported backend will be JaCoCo. There are not plans for a
  "plugable" architecture to facilitate different coverage engines. The
  technologies are simply too different to efficiently integrate them based on a
  common framework.
</p><p>
  Beside this we will try to maintain the EMMA based 1.x stream on a best effort
  base but with no functional enhancements planned. There will be a separate
  download for the 1.x versions.
</p><h2>Various Implementation Considerations</h2><p>
  For a new EclEmma 2.x the following ideas should be considered:
</p><ul>
  <li><b>API Compatibility:</b> As JaCoCo was explicitly designed for
      integration, EclEmma 2.0 should be far less complex than the existing
      1.x stream. To allow maximum reduction in code size and complexity several
      of the existing APIs can either be simplified or removed at all.</li>
  <li><b>Code Coverage Model:</b> Instead if defining a separate code coverage
      model for Eclipse IDE usage only the JaCoCo model will be used directly.</li>
  <li><b>Agent Communication:</b> Instead of writing Execution data to the file
      system, the TCP/IP base communication will be used. This will also allow
      intermediate dumps.</li>
  <li><b>Increase Testability and Test Coverage:</b> Cutting several static
      references to create more testable units will allow to increase unit test
      coverage of EclEmma itself.</li>
